# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to select a product type and analyze if Amazon Vine members are biased toward favorable reviews for these products. This analysis was done using a kitchen products dataset.

## Results

- There were 1,207 Vine reviews and 97,839 non-Vine reviews
- There were 509 5-star Vine reviews and 45,858 5-star non-Vine reviews
- 42.2% of Vine reviews were 5-stars and 46.9% of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars

## Summary
There is not positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. The percent of 5-star reviews for non-Vine users shows a higher percentage than the percent of 5-star reviews for Vine users. 

I would suggest further analysis in the dataset to determine what types of products are being purchased by both non-Vine and Vine users. It may be possible that Vine users are purchasing higher priced items like appliances and therefore only leave minimal reviews. While non-Vine users are reviewing a larger population of smaller appliances, cookware, flatware, etc. which accumulate into a larger amount of the total reviews.
